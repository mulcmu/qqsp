# Capacitive Nozzle Probe

This is still a work in progress but good enough to use with some limitations.

[Hackaday.io Project page](https://hackaday.io/project/194601-delta-printer-capacitive-nozzle-probe)

Nozzle needs to be clean and the contact pad needs to engage the bed uniformly.  The current attachment clips need to be adjusted so that contact pad is parallel to the bed.

The mylar arms that hold the contact pad limit probing area.  Along the outer edge of bed the arms hang off and the contact pad wobbles.

TODO

- [ ] Refine probing speed
- [ ] Test magnetic or direct to nozzle mounting
