### Collection of my FLSUN QQ-S Pro projects:

##### Wifi breakout board and buzzer

A small pcb to fit the mks wifi socket on the stock main board.  Includes a passive buzzer and header footprints to access the MCU gpio for wiring up mods.  This keeps the wiring tidy.

##### Capacitive Nozzle Probe

Concept probe to use capacitive touch input on an ESP32-S3 triggered by nozzle contact.  Working pretty well.
